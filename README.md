Project Overview
The "Anomaly Detection In Time Series Data" project aims to develop a robust anomaly detection system capable of identifying unusual patterns and outliers within time series data. Leveraging machine learning techniques and statistical analysis, the system provides valuable insights into anomalous events and potential issues in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of time series data collected from sensors, monitoring systems, or other sources capturing temporal trends and patterns. Each data point comprises timestamped observations representing various parameters, metrics, or measurements relevant to the specific domain.

Methodological Approach
Data Preprocessing:
The time series data undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize scales, and ensure temporal alignment across observations.

Anomaly Detection Techniques:
Multiple anomaly detection techniques are explored, including statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and hybrid approaches combining both.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Anomalies are detected using supervised or unsupervised learning methods, depending on the availability of labeled data. Models are trained on historical data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics to assess detection accuracy and false positive rates.

Model Interpretation and Insights
Insights gained from detected anomalies are analyzed and interpreted to understand underlying patterns, root causes, and potential implications. Visualizations, trend analysis, and domain-specific knowledge contribute to deriving meaningful insights from detected anomalies.
